hashtags
========

Hashtags is a game like Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity.  It is designed for phones so it may look a little weird on a full screen browser window.

1) Create a game and invite friends.
2) Players and Judge get a prompt.
3) Players choose from their hand of hashtags and pull images/video from Instagram corresponding to that hashtag.
4) Players anonymously submit to the judge an image/video to answer the prompt.
5) When all submissions are in, the judge selects the best answer and the player that submitted it gets a point.
6) Judge switches and the next round commences.


Technologies:

  Node.js with Express.js
  Socket.io
  Passport-Instagram (oAuth)
  Instagram API
  MongoDB with Mongoose
  Backbone.js
